# Biodiversity_Project
CodeCademy Portfolio Project

This project is from CodeCademy's Data Scientist: Analytics Career Path.

For this project, I was given data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.

I performed analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigated if there were any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, I cleaned, analyzed, and created meaningful visualisations of the data.
